# signal-back

In version 4.17.5, the Signal Android app introduced encrypted backups. While these are undoubtedly a security benefit over unencrypted backups, they do present an issue in being read into other systems or simply by their owner.

`signal-back` is intended to use the same decryption process as the Signal app uses when importing its backups, to make them readable without being used by the app.

# Current progress

The program so far is a relatively literal translation of the Java code into Rust. However, it **currently does not work**. Help would be greatly appreciated in figuring out the difference between the Rust and Java code.
